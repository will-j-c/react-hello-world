## Tech Stack

In the frontend, the tech stack was:

* React - Main framework
* React Router - used for FE routing
* Material UI - A library for react with many pre made components
* SASS - For CSS
* JSON web token - For encrypted data sending
* GSAP - For the animation
* Axios - for making the API calls

## Planning and Execution

The team initially suggested ideas to each other until we had a list to choose from. Once we had settled on Hello World, we had a planning session at GA campus where we mapped out features and drew basic wire frames on the whiteboard. 

With the white board session done, the routes and data schema were designed to incorporate the views and features that had been designed. 

We then spent a solid week on designing each view in figma and getting the flow and styling correct.

The back end was then prioritised, being substantially completed in one weekend to leave plenty of time to build the front end.

Front end works took approximately 1.5 weeks to complete and was significantly more difficult than initially expected. MUI has quite a steep learning curve and react state management would prove to be very tricky at times. 

## Issues faced

* Image uploads - The whole process of getting images uploaded and creating a decent user experience was painful. Thoughts for next time is have one person do the image front end and backend as this would save time.
* State management - There were numerous issues where state not updating immediately caused issues (such as image upload, checkboxes etc). Further practice is required to better understand when and where state will misbehave.
* Scope - Looking back on it now, the project was ambitious for 2.5 weeks. There are a lot of moving parts and it required much more time than expected to get everything set up.
